                                Cryolipolysis,
                                a revolutionary method of controlled cooling that targets fat cells without compromising
                                surrounding skin or tissues. The patented applicator chills subcutaneous fat cells,
                                causing
                                them
                                to rupture. This triggers an immune response wherein the lymphatic system collects and
                                eventually excretes these destroyed fat cells from the body.

                                Treatments may last anywhere from 35 to 75 minutes, depending on the area being treated.
                                After the procedure, the patient is free to return to their normal, daily activities,

                            <p>CoolSculpting reviews from patients attest to how well freezing fat works. However,

                                intrigued by this revolutionary body contouring treatment and have performed numerous
                                independent studies to scientifically gauge the safety and efficacy of Cryolipolysis.
                                These

                            </h4>
                            <p>Many patients wonder if after CoolSculpting, can the fat grow back? The simple answer is
                                no.
                                Once the fat is gone, it stays gone. To better understand the science of Cryolipolysis,
                                it
                                is important to distinguish CoolSculpting, a fat reduction treatment, from weight loss
                                treatments. While losing weight causes fat cells to shrink, Cool Sculpting freezes these
                                cells and removes them from the body. The skin and remaining fat adjust to accommodate
                                the
                                reduction of fat volume, resulting in thinner contours and improved definition in
                                treated
                                areas.

                            <p>Once the fat cells are removed, they are gone, but factors such as excessive weight gain
                                and
                                pregnancy can temporarily obscure your results. Maintaining a healthy body weight after
                                treatment can help you keep your trimmer, more toned figure.
