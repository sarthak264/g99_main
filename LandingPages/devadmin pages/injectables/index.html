                <p>
                    BOTOX® Cosmetic is a simple, non-surgical procedure that smoothes the deep, persistent lines between
                    your brows that develop over time. One 10-minute treatment – a few tiny injections – relaxes the
                    muscles that cause those lines to form and keeps them relaxed for up to 4 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BOTOX® Cosmetic targets one of the underlying causes of frown lines and crow’s feet—the repeated
                    muscle contractions from frowning and squinting over the years. We inject these muscles with BOTOX®
                    Cosmetic to temporarily reduce muscle activity. You will begin to notice a visible smoothing of your
                    crow’s feet lines and frown lines between your brows. BOTOX® Cosmetic has been widely tested. Now
                    it’s approved by the FDA. The results are dramatic and apparent within days
                </p>

                    Dysport<sup>®</sup>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dysport® is a purified formulation that has been shown to deliver temporary improvements in moderate
                    to severe frown lines, even with repeat treatments. So, the effect of repeat treatments may be
                    comparable to your first use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With just 1 injection into each of 5 points between and above the eyebrows, Dysport® blocks the
                    signal from the nerve to the muscles, ultimately resulting in a reduction of muscle activity and
                    temporarily preventing contraction of the muscles that cause frown lines.

                    Xeomin® is an injectable neuromodulator, or wrinkle relaxer, which temporarily disables nerve
                    impulses to targeted muscles. Similar to Botox®, Xeomin® can help reduce wrinkles caused by frequent
                    muscle contraction. Some common uses for Xeomin® include eyebrow lifting, reduction of frown lines,
                    crow’s feet, nasal squint lines or bunny lines, horizontal lines across the forehead, perpendicular
                    lines between the brows, lines around the neck, and even profuse underarm sweating and migraines.

                            Eczema is a common skin condition that any race or age can experience. For some, it recurs
                            throughout life; coming and going depending on the situation. While there is no exact cause
                            known, many people with eczema often have a history of allergies, asthma or hay fever. Dr.
                            Marina Buckley of MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology Surgery & Laser Center in Northeastern
                            Pennsylvania can offer different treatment options to manage eczema outbreaks.

                            the neck commonly referred to as the “double chin.” Kybella® contains a naturally occurring
                            molecule, called deoxycholic acid, that dissolves fat cells. When injected properly, all
                            other cells are left intact. The body then metabolizes and flushes out the dissolved fat
                            cells. Once these fat cells are eliminated from the body, they are gone for good!

                            If fuller lips are something you’ve always wanted, lip augmentation may be a great option
                            for you. Lip augmentation is a procedure that uses either synthetic products or your own fat
                            to enhance the shape and plumpness of your lips. Upper and lower lips can be treated alone
                            or together at the same time. Very fine blunt-tipped microcannulas are used, and the lips
                            should look and feel natural after treatment. Results are seen immediately.

                            addressing any loose skin at the same time. White and red marks require different

                            Tattoo Removal
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Tattoos are technically not a skin condition, but for those seeking treatment, it is an
                            imperfection they want corrected. Whatever the reason for its initial acquisition, the
                            tattoo has now outlived its purpose. Getting a tattoo is generally painful, so the removal
                            will also be uncomfortable. Several treatments will be needed to achieve optimal results and
                            patience is key, as the skin needs time to respond to each treatment.

                            Warts & Cysts
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Warts and cysts are growths on the skin that are visually unpleasing. Warts may develop on
                            any part of the body including the face, scalp, lips, nose and genital area as well as on
                            the hands, feet, elbows and knees. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body but commonly appear
                            on the face and scalp, trunk and fingernails. Before considering the removal of these skin
                            lesions, the cosmetic dermatologists at MilfordMD must first determine whether the skin
                            growth is benign or malignant in nature.

                        Dr. Buckley is a very knowledgeable, kind doctor with a great bedside manner. She makes
                        excellent
                        recommendations on possible procedures without putting undue pressure on the patient. The
                        results
                        are consistently excellent. Her staff is also friendly, courteous, and very professional. I

                        I have been seeing Dr. Marina Buckley for several years now for a variety of dermatological
                        issues.
                        My experiences with this office have exceeded my expectations. The office is modern and always
                        clean, there is little to no wait time to see one of the doctors, and the staff is friendly,
                        professional, and extremely competent.
