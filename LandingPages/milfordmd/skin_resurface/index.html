                    skin resurfacing procedures. In general, topical treatments can alleviate minor symptoms, but for
                    moderate to severe acne scarring, lasers are the best option. With over 29 different lasers on-site,
                    MilfordMD will be sure to have the perfect laser to treat your acne scars!

                        <p>
                            Eczema is a common skin condition that any race or age can experience. For some, it recurs
                            throughout life; coming and going depending on the situation. While there is no exact cause
                            known, many people with eczema often have a history of allergies, asthma or hay fever. Dr.
                            Marina Buckley of MilfordMD Cosmetic Dermatology Surgery & Laser Center in Northeastern
                            Pennsylvania can offer different treatment options to manage eczema outbreaks.

                            Birthmarks are abnormalities on the skin that are either due to vascular irregularities,
                            such as when blood vessels do not form correctly, or pigmentation irregularities, usually
                            when there are more than one pigment (or color) in your skin’s DNA. Treatment will vary
                            depending on which type of birthmark you are seeking to remove or reduce. In most cases, a
                            laser treatment will improve the appearance of birthmarks.

                    be related to melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It describes the signs of melanoma and explains how
                    you can check your skin for moles that might be cancerous. It also explains why and how you can
                    protect your skin.

                    Hypertrophic scars can develop after deep burn injury or any deep skin injury. Although hypertrophic
                    scars look similar to keloids, hypertrophic scars do not get a big as keloids. During the healing
                    process Hypertrophic scars can get itchy and painful, causing aesthetic and functional disability.

                    Port Wine Stains
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Port wine stains are caused by a vascular anomaly, which causes a capillary malformation on the
                    skin. They are considered birthmarks and their growth is in relation with the child’s growth. Port
                    wine stains are generally found on the scalp, face, neck, arms, and legs – but can grow anywhere on
                    the body. If left untreated, port-wine stains tend to darken over time as the blood flow through
                    them becomes more sluggish. At first the overlying skin is smooth and flat, but over time the
                    overlying skin can thicken and become lumpy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aesthetic laser treatments are generally recommended to improve the appearance of port wine stains.
                    Treatment must be repeated for optimal results. Depending on the severity of the birthmark, surgery
                    may be required.

                <p>
                    Sun damage, including sun spots, is caused by the over-exposure of harmful ultraviolet (UV) sun
                    rays. Sunbathing and constant sun exposure can put you at risk for abnormal skin discoloration,
                    wrinkling and skin cancer. When your skin darkens, to what we believe is a tan, it is actually a
                    sign of damage to the skin.

                <p>
                    UV photography provides physicians with an effective way to show patients the full extent of the
                    sun’s impact on their skin. The selective absorption of UV light by epidermal melanin makes it easy
                    to capture an image of the mottled hyperpigmentation that is characteristic of photodamage. The
                    results can often be quite shocking for patients, heightening their awareness of the need for sun
                    protection and raising a desire for treatment. A post-treatment UV photo compared to pre-treatment
                    shows the patient what’s been accomplished.

                            Until now, getting rid of stretch marks was a difficult task. Stretch marks are always a
                            concern for patients who have given birth or have lost weight. Laser liposuction is a great
                            option, as is the Thermage skin tightening procedure, which can also be instrumental in
                            addressing any loose skin at the same time. White and red marks require different
                            treatments.

                            Tattoos are technically not a skin condition, but for those seeking treatment, it is an
                            imperfection they want corrected. Whatever the reason for its initial acquisition, the
                            tattoo has now outlived its purpose. Getting a tattoo is generally painful, so the removal
                            will also be uncomfortable. Several treatments will be needed to achieve optimal results and
                            patience is key, as the skin needs time to respond to each treatment.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Warts and cysts are growths on the skin that are visually unpleasing. Warts may develop on
                            any part of the body including the face, scalp, lips, nose and genital area as well as on
                            the hands, feet, elbows and knees. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body but commonly appear
                            on the face and scalp, trunk and fingernails. Before considering the removal of these skin
                            lesions, the cosmetic dermatologists at MilfordMD must first determine whether the skin
                            growth is benign or malignant in nature.
