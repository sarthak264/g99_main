                    <p>Developed by Harvard scientists, CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> is the only treatment to utilize
                        Cryolipolysis,
                        a revolutionary method of controlled cooling that targets fat cells without compromising
                        surrounding skin or tissues. The patented applicator chills subcutaneous fat cells, causing them
                        to rupture. This triggers an immune response wherein the lymphatic system collects and
                        eventually excretes these destroyed fat cells from the body.

                            are not the only ones talking about CoolSculpting. Medical professionals are similarly
                            intrigued by this revolutionary body contouring treatment and have performed numerous
                            independent studies to scientifically gauge the safety and efficacy of Cryolipolysis. These
                            academic CoolSculpting reviews are published in a variety of medical journals
                        </p>
                        <p>One such CoolSculpting review is published in Clinical, Cosmetic, and Investigational
                            Dermatology. The research supports the efficacy of freezing away fat, reporting,
                            <b> “Cryolipolysis was shown to reduce subcutaneous fat at the treatment site by up to 25%
                                after one treatment.”¹
                            </b> With such a dramatic reduction in fat, it is no wonder that a scientific review of more
                            than 500 CoolSculpting patients found
                            <b> “89% of respondents report[ed] a positive perception of treatment duration and …82%

                            </b> Furthermore, the analysis reported,

                            experience visible results within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment. The most dramatic results

                        </h4>
                        <p>Many patients wonder if after CoolSculpting, can the fat grow back? The simple answer is no.
                            Once the fat is gone, it stays gone. To better understand the science of Cryolipolysis, it
                            is important to distinguish CoolSculpting, a fat reduction treatment, from weight loss
                            treatments. While losing weight causes fat cells to shrink, Cool Sculpting freezes these
                            cells and removes them from the body. The skin and remaining fat adjust to accommodate the
                            reduction of fat volume, resulting in thinner contours and improved definition in treated
                            areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once the fat cells are removed, they are gone, but factors such as excessive weight gain and
                            pregnancy can temporarily obscure your results. Maintaining a healthy body weight after
                            treatment can help you keep your trimmer, more toned figure.
                        </p>

                        <p>At Elite Medspa + Wellness Center, Dr. Lieman and her staff can help you achieve your

                            multiple areas of the body with two Cool Sculpting machines working at once. DualSculpting
                            safely cuts the time involved in treatments, allows for a more flexible treatment schedule,
                            and can help you achieve results in less time by addressing multiple areas at once.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition, Elite Medspa + Wellness Center carries the latest line of applicators to address
                            bulges and refine contours, even in those hard-to-reach areas. This allows us to provide a
                            more thorough treatment session because we can tailor the size of the applicator to your
                            individual needs.

                            known as a “double chin.” This area is often difficult to target with diet and exercise
                            alone, and at Elite Medspa + Wellness Center, we utilize the Cool Mini applicator for the
                            CoolSculpting® system to freeze chin fat and create a slimmer, more defined neck and
                            jawline. With results in as little as one or two treatments, the Cool Mini can be an ideal
                            solution to reduce your double chin without extensive procedures or downtime.

                            qualify for liposuction. During your consultation, factors such as your health, medical
                            history, and cosmetic goals will be evaluated to determine if this treatment is right for
                            your unwanted body fat.

                            liposuction is FDA cleared, has an incredible safety record, and is scientifically proven
                            “safe and effective.”¹ Cool Sculpting side effects are rare; however, temporary numbness,
                            redness, bruising or swelling may occur in treated areas but should subside shortly after
                            treatment.

                                            “natural” result that gracefully rolls back the hands of time without
                                            looking artificial.

                                            In January 2016, Dr. Lieman realized her vision of opening a science-led,
                                            luxury Medspa where she and her staff of highly trained professionals
                                            provide a personalized and reassuring approach to aesthetic medicine. She
                                            has since grown her practice to include a more holistic approach to beauty
                                            with the addition of nature-based wellness services and
                                            experiences…redefining outer and inner self-care for everyone.
