                    Weight loss becomes much more difficult as you get older. No matter how much you diet and exercise,
                    the scale refuses to budge. specifically, a hormone imbalance has affected the way that your body
                    regulates your weight. But you don’t have to bear this heavy burden once you realize that losing
                    weight begins by gaining hormones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can reverse your hormone imbalance and restore your ability to lose weight by simply
                    replenishing the hormones you’ve lost. Many patients seek hormone replacement therapy to help with
                    weight loss, replenishing lost hormones to help promote increased energy and metabolism.

                            Hormones that help with weight loss include:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>Testosterone:</b> This sex hormone produced by both men and women inhibits fat storage,
                            especially
                            in the abdomen. Low levels cause sugar cravings and may lead to insulin resistance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Estrone:</b> This form of estrogen helps women control their appetite and sugar cravings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Progesterone:</b> This sex hormone facilitates the conversion of stored body fat to
                            energy. It
                            is
                            often used in HRT for women since an imbalance of progesterone causes women to overeat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>DHEA:</b> A hormone that promotes weight loss by increasing the body’s metabolism,
                            preventing
                            fat
                            storage, and decreasing the appetite for dietary fats.
                            Human Growth Hormone (HGH): Naturally produced in the pituitary gland, this hormone is
                            needed to
                            convert body fat into muscle mass. It also inhibits the production of body fat and decreases
                            visceral and subcutaneous fats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Insulin:</b> In addition to regulating fat metabolism, this hormone causes glucose
                            absorption in
                            the
                            liver, muscles, and fat tissues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Incretin:</b> This hormone helps ensure an appropriate insulin response after eating by
                            preventing
                            elevated glucagon levels, producing a sense of fullness, curbing food intake, and slowing
                            the
                            rate of gastric emptying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Pregnenolone:</b> A powerful hormone that appears to regulate other hormones to prevent
                            the
                            abdominal fat storage and stress caused by cortisol, keep metabolism high, improve brain
                            function and memory, and provide rejuvenating effects.
