                <p>
                    When injected in small doses, Botox can safely and temporarily relax muscles by
                    blocking the chemical signals that cause them to contract. By preventing these muscles from
                    contracting and tightening, the skin will appear flatter, smoother, and less wrinkled overall.

                            Botox has a long safety record since it has been used for decades first as a medical product
                            and more recently as a cosmetic treatment. Botox used to address signs of aging is
                            explicitly known as
                            Botox Cosmetic. Botox is a safe and effective way to treat and reduce fine lines and
                            wrinkles.

                            For the right patient, Botox offers a host of potential benefits:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Quick treatment, no prep before and no downtime afterward
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Have procedure over lunch, head back to work with no visible signs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Injections are relatively comfortable
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Preliminary improvement immediately after your procedure
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Full results become evident in about two weeks
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Enhancements last a few months before a treatment is needed
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Although Botox is a fast, convenient procedure that produces excellent results for many
                            patients, it isn’t the right choice for everyone. Your Nurse Injector will discuss your
                            concerns and aesthetic goals in detail to determine whether Botox will meet your needs best.

                            There are many good reasons why Botox is a top cosmetic treatment today. The procedure is
                            quick, relatively comfortable and the results are nearly instant. You can stop by J Michelle
                            Med Spa on a lunch hour, get your injections and head back to work without anyone knowing
                            where you spent your break. With regular treatment sessions, you can extend your positive
                            results indefinitely. To learn more about the benefits of Botox, contact J Michelle Med Spa
