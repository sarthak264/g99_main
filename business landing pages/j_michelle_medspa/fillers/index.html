                    What are Dermal Fillers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dermal fillers tend to be one of the most requested anti-aging treatments today, due to their ease
                    of use and their ability to create a variety of quick improvements. Dermal fillers help to smooth
                    away facial lines and replenish lost volume and fullness in the face. They can also correct nagging
                    imperfections that aren’t necessarily associated with aging, such as shallow scarring and facial
                    asymmetries. Dermal fillers can be integral for those with early signs of aging when used alone, or
                    as a component in facial rejuvenation surgery to enhance results further.

                            Dermal fillers are a good option for men and women looking to turn back the clock or
                            camouflage imperfections without incisions or downtime. These formulas work on all skin
                            tones and types, and an array of products allow for them to be used safely and successfully
                            on nearly any area of the face.

                            Dermal fillers usually take just a few minutes to complete, with results that can last for
                            many months in most cases. You can also schedule regular treatment sessions to ensure your
                            effects last indefinitely. Fillers are an ideal treatment for men and women that want to
                            refresh or enhance their appearance without incisions, anesthesia or a recovery process. To
