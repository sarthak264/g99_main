                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> vs. Diet & Exercise
            </h2>
            <p>
                Diet and exercise can only decrease the size of fat cells — they cannot get rid of them. Localized fat
                deposits that do not respond to such measures (or do not reduce in size past a certain point) are what
                we refer to as diet-or exercise-resistant fat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://germaindermatology.app.growth99.com/service/howdoescoolsculptingwork"
                    target="_blank">Cryolipolysis<sup>®</sup>
                    process</a> of CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> actually
                destroys fat cells
                (without harming the skin or
                other tissues). Once crystallized, the targeted fat cells die naturally, and are ultimately expelled by
                the body as waste. In fact, the best candidates for CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup>
                are those
                who are within a normal
                weight range but have specific areas of diet-or exercise-resistant fat on their body that they would
                like to address. CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> does not result in noticeable weight loss and is not a weight
                loss
                procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to note that while the fat cells targeted by CoolSculpting® are destroyed, the rest of
                the fat cells in the body can still grow with substantial weight gain. To maintain your results, it is
                necessary to commit to healthy eating and regular exercise — in other words, a healthy lifestyle goes
                hand in hand with CoolSculpting®!
            </p>
            <p class="smaller-text text-center">
                CoolSculpting® at the Charleston, SC, area’s Germain Dermatology is a nonsurgical procedure for fat
                reduction that works best for reducing bulges and slimming down the hips, thighs, bra roll, flanks,
                and
                abdomen. This treatment is ideal for small and moderate areas of fat and requires no downtime after.
                Patients usually notice a gradual 20 to 35 percent fat reduction. Liposuction is a surgical
                procedure
                that involves a surgeon making incisions to physically extract fat for a more dramatic change. This
                surgery is more appropriate for patients who want to remove greater amounts of fat, but its
                versatility
                means it can be used almost anywhere on the body. Post-lipo recovery down time can take up to one
                week,
                and it may be up to six weeks before you can exercise. Each surgery can result in up to a 70 percent
                reduction in fat.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> vs. Liposuction
            </h2>
            <p>
                CoolSculpting® and liposuction are both long-term methods of fat reduction, but the ways they work are
                quite different. Liposuction is a surgical, invasive procedure that requires anesthesia and incisions to
                be made so that the surgeon can physically extract fat out of the body. While the fat reduction occurs
                immediately, it takes some time for the body to recover from the trauma of surgery — which often
                includes moderate to severe swelling, bruising, and soreness around the incision sites. There can also
                be drainage and risk of infection.
            </p>
            <p>
                CoolSculpting®, however, is a gradual process that is much gentler on the body. Once the fat cells
                crystallize, they lose the energy to function and die. The body then flushes them out naturally over the
                next one to four months post treatment, after which you will be able to see noticeable results.
                Depending on your customized treatment plan, multiple treatment sessions may be required to achieve
                maximum results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Liposuction may be a more appropriate treatment for certain patients seeking more extensive fat
                reduction, but this cannot be determined until a certified and experienced provider performs an
                in-person assessment to see whether this is truly required. Many patients are happy with the significant
                20 to 25 percent fat reduction they achieve with a non-invasive, gentler procedure such as
                CoolSculpting®. Many others may also find that they are not an appropriate candidate for surgery or
                would prefer not to deal with the (often significant) risks, medication, expenses, discomfort, scarring,
                and downtime that a surgical procedure entails.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional liposuction will not tighten the skin. In fact, there are some patients who find that skin
                laxity may accompany significant fat reduction after liposuction if excess skin removal is not performed
                in conjunction with the procedure. Because CoolSculpting® is a more gradual process, the skin has more
                time to conform to slimmer contours. It is also the first non-invasive fat reduction procedure of its
                kind that is FDA-cleared to tighten skin in the chin area. While liposuction performed with the
                assistance of a laser may result in a limited amount of skin tightening, it is still a surgical
                procedure that requires incisions to do so.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                Cryolipolysis<sup>®</sup> vs. Other Non-Surgical Fat Reduction Methods
            </h2>
            <p>
                CoolSculpting® is based on the principle of Cryolipolysis®, in which fat cells are crystallized with
                controlled cooling. This crystallization simply takes away the cell’s energy, triggering a process known
                as apoptosis or natural cell death. In other words, CoolSculpting® is simply a catalyst that jumpstarts
                the body’s natural cell death process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most other forms of non-surgical fat reduction work by rupturing the cells’ membranes to force them to
                die unnaturally. They do not work in tandem with the body’s own systems, as CoolSculpting® does.
                Cryolipolysis® also has other unique advantages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Because it has been around longer, Cryolipolysis® has been much more extensively studied for both
                    safety and efficacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As of late 2017, CoolSculpting® is the first (and currently only) non-surgical fat reduction device
                    that is FDA-cleared for skin tightening of the chin. It is also currently cleared to treat more
                    areas of the body than other FDA-cleared non-surgical fat treatment devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other devices’ applicators are typically small and uniformly shaped and are not as efficient as the
                    CoolSculpting® applicators (which come in a variety of sizes and shapes) in treating larger or more
                    uniquely shaped areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other devices’ applicators do not utilize a vacuum suction, which means they may not as precisely or
                    efficiently target pinchable fat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is currently no other FDA-cleared non-surgical device that can achieve 20 to 25 percent fat
                    reduction after a single treatment.
                </li>
