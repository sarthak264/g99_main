            </h2>
            <p>
                While the term “fat reduction” has long been used to refer to the goal of body sculpting efforts, it has
                only recently entered the everyday, mainstream vocabulary in its true meaning. Even today, many people
                equate fat reduction with weight reduction — but the truth is, they mean very different things. Read on
                to learn about what exactly fat reduction is from the Charleston, SC-based specialists at Germain
                Dermatology.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would be happy to offer you a free, no-commitment, personalized consultation about how you can
                achieve your goals for fat reduction.

                What’s the Difference Between Fat Reduction & Weight Reduction?
            </h2>
            <p>
                It can be a bit puzzling to learn that fat reduction is not necessarily the same as losing weight. The
                total mass or weight of our body is a combination of fat, muscle, bone, organs, and water. If the amount
                of muscle reduces, for example, you will see a reduction in weight — but the amount of fat in your body
                may still be the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have heard the phrase, “muscle weighs more than fat.” This is not actually true, but it is an
                understandable myth. A pound of muscle does weigh the same as a pound of fat. But because fat is
                fluffier or less dense, it takes up more space than the equivalent weight of muscle (which is denser and
                more compact). This is why even if you might see a reduction in your overall weight, your size or shape
                might not change — the fat that takes up a lot of room might not have actually gone anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further explain what we mean, let’s consider a case of two individuals — Patricia and Gayle. Patricia
                and Gayle each weigh 150 lbs and have the same daily calorie intake, yet Pat is three sizes smaller than
                Kyle. As Patricia is a lot more active and has a high-protein diet, she has significantly more muscle
                than Gayle, who is not particularly active and has a diet rich in carbohydrates. Gayle’s body has more
                body fat (which takes up more room than muscle), which makes it possible for her to weigh the same as
                Patricia yet still be larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to be slimmer and more toned, weight reduction should not be your focus — fat
                reduction should.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                How Do I Achieve Fat Reduction?
            </h2>
            <p>
                While scientists continue to uncover more information about the nature of fat cells, the consensus is
                that the number of fat cells in a person’s body becomes fixed by your early 20s. There only two ways to
                reduce fat in the body — by either reducing the cells’ size or numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The body requires adequate protein intake and energy sources to repair and build muscle tissue. If it
                gets enough protein from your diet, it can burn fat to obtain its energy. Therefore, muscle building can
                actually aid fat reduction efforts — and a muscular body with less fat covering it is a more toned one.
                When someone makes intelligent use of diet and exercise, the size of the fat cells reduces — but their
                numbers remain constant. Diet and exercise cannot reduce the number of fat cells (leaving them open to
                becoming larger again), and they certainly cannot target fat cells in specific areas of the body — where
                you are most likely to lose or gain fat is governed by your genetics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cooling process induced by CoolSculpting® works by taking energy away from fat cells in specific,
                targeted areas of the body. Once the energy is taken away from them, they die naturally and are
                gradually flushed out through the body’s natural processes. CoolSculpting® is not meant to be a
                substitute for healthy diet and exercise — in fact, they go hand in hand. CoolSculpting® can bridge the
                gap by targeting localized areas of fat that are out of reach, and a healthy diet and exercise regimen
                can ensure that the remaining fat cells in the body do not become larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incorporating CoolSculpting® into your diet and exercise efforts can reduce not just the size of current
                fat cells but also the amount, helping you stay slim and healthy in the long run.
