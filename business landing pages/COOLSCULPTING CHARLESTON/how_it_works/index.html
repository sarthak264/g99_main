            <p>
                From Googling “how to lose belly fat” to stressing over chin rolls in a selfie, most of us have a few
                pockets of fat here and there that we would like to slim down. Fortunately, we no longer live in an age
                where we are forced to accept the very real limitations of dieting and exercise, and
                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> has
                become one of the most effective, long-term methods of fat reduction. But how exactly does
                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> work? South Carolina’s <span class="blue">Dr. Marguerite Germain</span>,
                serving
                Summerville and beyond,
                explains.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to understand that CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> cannot be used as a weight loss method but
                is an
                effective treatment to target unwanted, localized areas of fat on patients who are within a healthy
                weight range and are committed to staying that way through adequate dietary and exercise measures. Learn
                more about how fat reduction differs from weight reduction <span class="blue">here</span>.

                What is Cryolipolysis<sup>®</sup>?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The term Cryolipolysis<sup>®</sup> is a portmanteau or combination of three other words: “cryogenic” +
                “lipid” +
                “lysis.” In lay terms, this simply means “fat-freezing breakdown,” and is the working principle behind
                the CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> device.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process was first discovered at Harvard University, where the scientists Dieter Manstein, MD, and
                R. Rox Anderson, MD, noticed that some children developed dimples in their cheeks after consuming
                popsicles. Upon further investigation, the researchers found that the cold temperature of the popsicles
                produced these results by freezing small pockets of fat cells (the leftovers of these were flushed
                naturally from the body).
            </p>
            <p>
                This theory that cold could result in fat reduction was applied to CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> technology.
                The result
                is a safe, FDA-cleared device that can break down fat cells while leaving the skin and other surrounding
                tissues unharmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> gradually cools the treatment area in a controlled manner to a temperature of
                about 39°
                F, at which fat cells crystallize and eventually die, while skin or other types of vital cells stay
                unharmed — this is what is often referred to as “selective destruction of fat cells.” Over time, the fat
                cells crystallized through CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> break down and get flushed out of the body through
                its own
                natural processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the affected cells leave the body, the remaining fat cells in the area can still grow with weight
                gain. We emphasize following a healthy diet and exercise regimen to maintain long-term results.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                Where You Receive Your CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> Treatment Matters
            </h2>
            <p>
                While the Cryolipolysis<sup>®</sup> process may sound relatively simple, placing a bag of frozen peas
                over the area
                is simply not the same — cold-assisted lipolysis must be performed at a safe temperature range under the
                supervision of an appropriately licensed and trained medical professional, and should be targeted enough
                so that the heat energy is being taken away precisely at the areas where fat reduction is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                We firmly believe that no matter where you choose to receive treatment, the highest standards of both
                effectiveness and safety can only be maintained at a medical-grade facility supervised by a
                board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon, with licensed and trained providers administering
                treatment.

                Which Areas of the Body Can CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> Treat?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Because of the wide range of applicators available, CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> can be used on nearly any
                area of the
                body. The device is FDA-cleared to treat fat deposits in the following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Submentum (under the chin)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upper arms
                </li>
                <li>
                    Back fat (especially bra bulge)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banana roll (fatty area under buttocks)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inner and outer thighs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Abdomen and tummy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flanks (love handles)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knees
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> is also FDA-cleared to tighten lax skin tissue under the chin when used in
                conjunction
                with its cold-assisted lipolysis.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                What to Expect During a CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> Treatment Session
            </h2>
            <p>
                After a thorough consultation, you will determine with one of our CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> specialists
                which body
                parts you would like to target for fat reduction, and the details of your package (such as number and
                duration of treatment sessions, pre-and post-treatment care, cost, complementary procedures, etc.) will
                be set.
            </p>
            <p>
                No pre-treatment anesthetic is required, as the CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> process is not expected to be
                painful.
                Cooling panels will be placed over the fatty area to draw it in via vacuum for ample and even controlled
                cooling — the only exception to this is when the CoolSmooth PRO™ applicator is used to treat
                non-pinchable fat, as it does not utilize vacuum suction.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> device starts to gradually cool down the area, you may feel a moderate
                to intense
                cooling sensation. Patients tend to adjust to this temperature change relatively quickly and spend the
                rest of the session being able to read, use mobile devices, or even take a nap. Our provider will check
                on your progress as the session continues.
            </p>
            <p>
                A typical CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> session at our practice lasts between 30 minutes to two hours,
                depending on the
                number and size of the areas being treated. This also affects the total number of sessions that may be
                required to achieve your desired results.
