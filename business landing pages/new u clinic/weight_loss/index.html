                    VOTED TRI-CITIES BEST WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our weight loss program focuses on changing your lifestyle and not just focusing on another diet.
                    Our
                    program is medically supervised by practitioners who are trained in weight management. Dr. Fidino,
                    as
                    well as our COO, Andrew Fidino, are previous National Fitness Competitors, and they take their
                    medical
                    background as well as their prior competing history to allow our program to be like no other in the
                    area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were voted Tri Cities Best Weight Loss Program and we see an average of 10-15 pounds of
                    predictable
                    weight loss a month. Our patients can continue the program for $500+ per month. When you come to see
                    us,
                    you will receive a consultation with one of our medical providers, and we will tailor the program to
                    meet your goals and expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Fidino has been studying weight loss success and helping patients keep the weight off for over
                    13
                    years. Josie Ponce, ARNP, also sees patients for weight loss and she is a living testament to the
                    program, losing over 90 pounds. At New U Womenâ€™s Clinic & Aesthetics, we practice what we preach.
                    Our
                    patients do not yoyo after they are no longer on the program because they are living a new lifestyle
                    that is easy to maintain. We have several patients who have lost over 100 pounds with us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The weight loss program is currently on SALE through the end of March! If you sign up for 3 months
                    on
                    the program, you will receive 4 weeks of Semiglutide for FREE!

                    <p>
                        Semaglutide is a synthetic GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist). It is an FDA-approved
                        once-a-week injectable medication used to lose weight among patients with a body mass index
                        greater than 30 or greater than 27 with comorbidities. People with type 2 diabetes and obesity
                        have lower levels of this peptide than normal. A GLP-1 receptor agonist works by stimulating the
                        pancreas to produce ideal amounts of insulin to help move sugar from the blood to the tissues,
                        where it can be used for energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Elon Musk now appear slimmer thanks to Semiglutide.
                        Seeing its first appearance on the market last year, Semiglutide has been a big hit with
                        patients, doctors, and celebrities alike. In clinical trials, the weekly shot reduced body
                        weight by 15 percent over 68 weeks, making it the most effective weight loss medication on the
                        market. Earlier this year, Elon Musk said the drug helped him transform his body, and Kim
                        Kardashian claimed it had helped her lose 16 pounds in three weeks before the Met Gala.
