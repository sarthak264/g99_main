                                <b>Urinary Incontinence</b> is the involuntary leakage of urine. It is a common and
                                often
                                embarrassing problem. Urinary incontinence isn’t just for those who are aging, it can
                                affect pregnant and postpartum women, and those who are obese, as a result of changes in
                                lifestyle, dietary issues, or medical conditions.

                                <b>Vaginal dryness</b> is caused when the thin layer of moisture that coats the walls of
                                the
                                vagina, changes. This is often the result or hormonal changes that cause the vaginal
                                walls to thin, meaning they have fewer cells to secrete moisture. This decrease in
                                moisture is what leads to vaginal dryness

                                <b>Vaginal Laxity</b> often occurs during aging, childbirth, and with certain medical
                                conditions that affect the level of collagen production in the vaginal walls. With
                                vaginal laxity comes decreased libido, lack of sexual arousal, and a reduction in sexual
                                satisfaction.

                            esthetics. our Aviva procedure dramatically reduces the recovery time, uses a local
                            anesthetic and requires no stitches. It’s easy, safe, and gives women back the peace of mind
