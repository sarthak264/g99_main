                Dr. Grossman considers breast augmentation with fat the best procedure as long as the patient has enough
                fat for harvest and transfer. In the procedure of fat grafting, the patient’s own fat and stem cells are
                being placed in to the breasts for augmentation with permanent results when done by Dr. Grossman. Fat
                Transfer or Fat Grafting to the breasts is a safe and reliable procedure when done by NYC Breast
                Surgeon, Dr. Leonard Grossman. Just like Liposuction of the breasts can result in smaller breasts,
                adding your own (autologous) fat results in larger breasts.

                            The procedure of fat transfer in breast augmentation consists of two parts.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Using a syringe or specialized vacuum pump and a very small cannula (needle-like
                                instrument), fat is harvested or removed from the areas where it is not wanted: in the
                                thighs, waistline or the abdomen.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These fat cells, which have a high content of adult stem cells, are then washed,
                                centrifuged and chemically stabilized for transfer. Live fat and stem cells are then
                                injected in to the breasts scarlessly with a specially modified needle.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once in the breasts, these fat and stem cells will survive permanently and live just like
                            they did in the area where they were harvested.

                                    As a patient, you should expect an increase in the breast size of approximately one
                                    to one and a half cup sizes from a single procedure of fat-stem cell transfer.
                                    Should a greater increase in the breast size be desired, the same procedure might
                                    have to be repeated.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you desire to have an increase in two cups sizes or greater performed as a single
                                    procedure, then breast augmentation using saline or silicone breast implants should
                                    be considered. When performed by Dr. Grossman, the removal and harvest of fat is so
                                    gentle, that the majority of our patients don’t even bruise, they also rarely have
                                    discomfort for which anything more than Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen is required. Dr.
                                    Grossman’s patients don’t need any kind of compression garments, they can go to work
                                    the very next day, the gym in just a few days and best of all…. hit the beach in
                                    just one week with open water swimming being perfectly safe as well.

                                    The Breasts will feel natural and pain free almost right away, except may be for
                                    some swelling, which goes down rather quickly.

                            The price of NYC breast augmentation with fat stem cell transfer varies according to the
                            areas where the fat is harvested from, as well as the volume of the procedure and the
                            delicate nature of the procedure. Patient’s medical history and condition are very important
                            in the decision making process, since the patients’ safety is of paramount importance.
