                Bow legs or bowed legs, bowlegs, also known as bowleggedness are a condition of the legs that make a
                person appear as if they are straddling something while standing. In most people of this group, the
                lower legs have a gap between the calf muscles that is larger than desired or considered to be the norm.
                In some people, the whole leg is so severely bowed that the knees are far apart while standing.

                            Bowed legs can be caused by several factors, aside from a child’s fetal development. If the
                            bowed legs remain present throughout the child’s growth and into adulthood, there may be an
                            underlying medical condition, including the following illnesses:

                                Improperly healed fractures

                            <li>
                                Severe bowlegs can lead to physical difficulties later in life, in some cases
                                necessitating
                                surgical intervention.

                        <p>
                            Additionally, the cosmetic appearance of the legs in bow-legged individuals can severely
                            affect their self-esteem, especially if the person with the condition is a child who is
                            being teased.

                                    When bowed leg condition is mild, a child may be given special shoes to wear, braces
                                    or even casts to straighten out the legs. However, if the condition is of the less
                                    severe degree and involves the lower legs only and does not spontaneously regress,
                                    it can be treated with plastic surgery. If you reside in New York and surrounding
                                    areas and are suffering from the embarrassment caused by bowed legs, you feel
                                    embarrassed to wear shorts or skirts, Dr. Leonard Grossman can help restore
                                    alignment to your legs and eliminate the physical and mental anguish caused by this
                                    condition permanently.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Surgical correction of bowed legs works extremely well for patients of any age.
                                    However, it is a procedure best performed in adolescence and adulthood. Because
                                    young children continue to grow until their teen years, plastic surgery is not
                                    always recommended as a solution to the condition.

                            In the procedure, which was in fact invented by Dr. Grossman, the portions of the legs are
                            addressed first and only if needed for better symmetry and esthetic appearance. Fat is
                            harvested form the areas where it is not wanted and where your own stem cell count is
                            naturally high. The harvested fat is processed in a way as to keep the cells alive with a
                            maximum stem cell count, and then the fat is injected with specialized cannulas in to any,
                            required portion of the calf or the ankle, bulking up the calf and the ankle in a way as to
                            bring the proportions of the legs to a norm. In the similar fashion, any portion of the calf
                            or the leg can be corrected.
