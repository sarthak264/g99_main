                Calf Augmentation With Fat was invented, developed and perfected by Dr. Leonard Grossman in 1995. From
                1995 to 2023 Dr. Grossman, as the only plastic surgeon to offer such a procedure, has performed over
                4,000 Calf Augmentation procedures with nearly 100% of graft-take. The procedure of Calf Augmentation
                with Fat Grafting or Fat Transfer is used to build structure anywhere below the knees. The procedure of
                Calf Augmentation with Fat in New York City is ideal for individuals whose legs look too thin or not
                proportionate to the rest of their body.
            </p>
            <p>
                This procedure can also correct bow-leggedness, deformity after cerebral palsy or club foot surgery, as
                well as polio, arthritis, spine injury, or any kind of trauma or asymmetry in the legs.

                            Dr. Grossman will perform fat harvesting from an area of the body where the fat is rich in
                            stem cells. The fat will be centrifuged and processed in order to create the best mixture
                            for transfer. The fat will then be injected into the calves using a small cannula through a
                            needle hole making this procedure practically scarless. Calf augmentation with fat in NYC
                            may be the absolute best procedure when it comes to Augmentation of the lower legs. There
                            are many advantages and practically no disadvantages to this procedure as compared with Calf
                            Augmentation using Implants.

                                    Fat grafting, on the other hand, can address any area of the face or body, from the
                                    head to the little toe. Small or large amounts of fat can be injected into just
                                    about anywhere as long as the skin stretch allows for it. When Dr. Grossman performs
                                    fat transfer to the calf area, not only is the amount of fat under the skin
                                    increased, but the muscle size is also increased, through the process of injecting
                                    patients with their own stem cells. Only after the procedure of fat/stem cell
                                    transfer, can a patient start working out and see their calves actually grow in
                                    size, unlike with any other procedure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The only limitation of calf augmentation through fat grafting is the amount of good
                                    fat available, and the stretchability of the skin in the area where fat is being
                                    injected. In many patients, the fat doesnâ€™t just go into the calf, but into the
                                    ankle area creating improved proportions and harmony.
                                </p>

                                    With the procedure of fat transfer to the calves:
                                </p>

                                    <li>
                                        Patients can walk immediately after, with mild tightness in the calf area. This
                                        tightness goes away in a matter of days.
                                    </li>

                                        Most patients after such a procedure with Dr. Grossman are able to return to
                                        work
                                        the very next day.

                        recovery was easier than I expected it to be. Doctor Grossman is great, he took time to explain

                            In the procedure, which was in fact invented by Dr. Grossman, the portions of the legs are
                            addressed first and only if needed for better symmetry and esthetic appearance. Fat is
                            harvested form the areas where it is not wanted and where your own stem cell count is
                            naturally high. The harvested fat is processed in a way as to keep the cells alive with a
                            maximum stem cell count, and then the fat is injected with specialized cannulas in to any,
                            required portion of the calf or the ankle, bulking up the calf and the ankle in a way as to
                            bring the proportions of the legs to a norm. In the similar fashion, any portion of the calf
                            or the leg can be corrected.
