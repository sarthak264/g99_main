                Transumbilical Breast Augmentation, commonly referred to, as T.U.B.A. or scar-less belly button breast
                augmentation, is a procedure used to increase the breast size by introduction of breast implants through
                the umbilicus (navel or the belly button) and then inflating them to a requested size.In the hands of a
                NYC Plastic Surgeon, Dr. Leonard Grossman, this surgery has proven to be only beneficial, with fewer
                complications over the traditional methods of breast augmentation by being safer, faster (average time
                of 20 minutes) and less invasive procedure creating larger breasts without visible scars on the breasts
                or in the armpit.

                            Transumbilical Breast Augmentation has many benefits and is the most effective method at
                            delivering the desired results to the patient, with less downtime and post-operative care as
                            compared with traditional surgery. This endoscopic assisted technique has many advantages,
                            among them when the patient wants the breast size substantially increased, not just 1 or 2
                            cup sizes, but 3 or more. Reason being, there is no tension on the incision line in TUBA.

                        <p>
                            Frequently patients needing a mastopexy (breast lift) and augmentation can have TUBA, which
                            will lift and enlarge the breasts totally without scars all in one procedure. If you desire
                            larger breasts, need breast reconstruction, do not want scars, or need a lift and are in
                            good physical and mental condition –T.U.B.A. is definitely the procedure for you.

                                    ADVANTAGES OF TUBA:

                                        No scars on or near the breast.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Breasts look more natural quicker than with any other approach.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Chances of losing sensation to the nipple or the breast are considerably smaller
                                        than with traditional approach (less than 1% with TUBA).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        No bleeding complications have occurred in more than 6,000. In traditional
                                        breast augmentation there is always some bleeding caused by cutting.

                                    <li>
                                        Fewer anesthesia requirements and no post-operative nausea or vomiting.

                                    <li>
                                        Less pain postoperatively (most patients take nothing “strong” for pain the day
                                        after surgery).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Implants can be placed under or over the muscle (99% of our patients get under
                                        the muscle implants).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Fewer capsular contractures occur with TUBA (in our experience less than 1%).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Implants can be quickly exchanged the very same way at any time (through the
                                        belly button): for new implants, larger or smaller ones.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        One exception to the above rule: patients, who have capsular contractures, will
                                        require open revision surgery.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        All implants come with a lifetime manufacturer’s warranty.
                                    </li>

                                        Most patients can resume gym exercise in 5 to 7 days.

                        I went to Dr Grossman for a TUBA breast augmentation. Dr Grossman really made me feel
                        comfortable about my procedure and helped me determine what size I wanted to go to. I was super

                        I had my breast augmentation in 2018. I was very young. It’s been years and it’s always amazing
                        the compliments I get. Absolutely no scaring. I did the TUBA procedure and I recommend

                            THE TRUTH IS: EVERYONE WHO DESIRES LARGER BREASTS IS A CANDIDATE FOR TUBA EVEN IF THEY NEED
                            A BREAST LIFT. Surgeons who have not been trained in this technique often scoff at its
                            safety and efficacy even though there are fewer complications, better results, and less
                            physical stress to the patient with this particular approach.
