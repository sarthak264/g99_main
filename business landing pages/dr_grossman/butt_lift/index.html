                Brazilian Butt Lift, Brazilian Butt Fill, or Building Brazilian Buttocks (BBB) is a term that Dr.
                Grossman coined around 1996 when he pioneered and perfected the procedure, in which the patient’s own
                Fat Cells combined with Stem Cells are placed into the fatty tissues of the buttocks for augmentation
                with permanent results. The procedure of Fat Transfer also known as Fat Grafting with a mix of the
                patient's own Stem Cells in Butt Augmentation consists of two parts: Liposuction (Fat Harvest and
                Filling or Transferring the fat into the Buttocks).

                            Using a Vacuum device and a very small cannula (needle-like instrument), fat is harvested or
                            removed from the areas where it is not wanted: the saddlebags, thighs, back, waist, or
                            abdomen. (as a side note, this improves the proportions of the body by itself)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The live fat cells are then washed and chemically stabilized for transfer. Pure fat is then
                            centrifuged in order to isolate the highest concentration of Stem Cells and Live Fat
                            suitable for transfer. Live Fat and Stem Cell mixture is then injected into the buttocks
                            completely without any visible scars. These Fat and Stem Cells will then take and reside in
                            the buttocks permanently just like they did in the area where they came from.

                                    The Brazilian Butt Augmentation or Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) procedure in NYC is
                                    normally done under IV Sedation (twilight anesthesia), which results in NO
                                    postoperative nausea and much easier recovery than with general anesthesia. Dr.
                                    Grossman is against having the BBL procedure done under local anesthesia alone as
                                    this creates an enormous amount of stress on the patient and the suffering can be
                                    tremendous. Twilight or Propofol anesthesia is the safest form of anesthesia for
                                    this type of procedure.
                                </p>

                                    How is this procedure better than buttocks (silicone) implants you may ask?
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                        The procedure of buttocks augmentation using implants is generally associated
                                        with a nearly 50% complication rate as compared with less than 1% complication
                                        rate
                                        with (BBL) the Fat Transfer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The sub-muscular Brazilian buttocks lift implants result in severe postoperative
                                        pain, requiring heavy narcotic use. Not so in BBL – no post-op pain in the
                                        buttocks at all.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Infections are quite common in Buttock Lift implants, whereas in BBL we have
                                        never had an infection since 1996.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Seromas or fluid accumulations with Buttocks Implants have greater than 30%
                                        occurrence and it’s less than 1% in BBL in New York City.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        With silicone Butt implants, the patients cannot walk or run normally for weeks
                                        if not months, with BBL you can walk normally right away and you can start
                                        running just one week later.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        With silicone buttocks implants the implants may shift over time, distorting the
                                        shape of the buttocks and creating discomfort, whereas in BBL this never
                                        happens.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Drawback of the BBL Fat Transfer is that not everyone has enough fat for the
                                        procedure. In patients who are thin and do not have excess fat on the body, Dr.
                                        Grossman has been using Sculptra Filler as a replacement for providing patients
                                        with a natural-looking yet shapelier buttock in a nonsurgical manner. The
                                        procedure of NON-SURGICAL BBL using Sculptra has been used in our office since
                                        1997 with average results of 2 to 6 years and in some patients greater than 20
                                        years without any sign of resorption.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Another drawback of Fat Transfer is that some of the fat may not take, but as
                                        long as you follow our directions, you should retain most of the fat.
