                A buttock lift is a cosmetic surgery to improve the appearance of the buttocks. It may be done as part
                of a tummy tuck. Or it may be done as part of a lower body lift to contour the buttocks, groin, thighs,
                and abdomen. During a buttock lift, excess skin and fat are removed from the buttocks. The remaining
                skin is then repositioned to create a more toned look.

                            A buttock lift alone won't add volume to the buttocks. But sometimes a buttock lift is
                            combined with an augmentation. An augmentation alters the shape or size of the buttocks with
                            implants or fat taken from other parts of the body.With age, the skin changes and becomes
                            looser. In addition, sun damage, changes in weight and genetic factors can make it harder
                            for skin to spring back into place after being stretched. These factors can cause the
                            buttocks and other parts of the body to sag.

                                    A buttock lift is typically done in combination with other body contouring
                                    procedures. You might consider a buttock lift if you:

                        I had too much fat added to my hips which were not even and my buttocks was not proportioned
                        well. I also wanted to get rid of the cellulite on my buttocks which I hated and I decided that
                        Dr. Grossman was the perfect Dr. I had surgery and it went well. I am very happy with the
                        results. Thank You Dr. Grossman and thanks to your friendly staff.
